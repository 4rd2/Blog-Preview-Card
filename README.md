## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about CSS transitions and how to smoothly animate properties like color changes on hover. I also explored flexbox, which helps in creating flexible and centered layouts efficiently.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="container">
    <p class="text">Hover over me!</p>
  </div>
```
```css
.text:hover {
      color: blue;
    }
```
